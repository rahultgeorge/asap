Phases
# - First step: -asap-init
#   Creates the ASAP state directory, which contains all the additional files
#   that ASAP manages throughout a compilation.
#   After asap-init, the software is ready to be compiled.
# - Second step: -asap-coverage
#   Prepares the compilation with coverage instrumentation. After this step,
#   the software should be compiled again, and the resulting binary will be
#   instrumented for coverage.
# - Third step: -asap-compute-costs
#   Collects sanity checks and computes their costs
# - Fourth step: -asap-optimize
#   Prepares for optimized compilation. Running make/ninja again after this
#   should result in an optimized binary.


Based on sum
-fsanitize- flag is set for all stages
For step 1 asap-clang  -asap-init
For step 2 asap-clang -asap-coverage
For step 3 & 4 asap-clang -asap-optimize

Sanity level
-> Removes hot checks till sanity level but counts frequency as well?

Cost threshold
-> No check greater than the threshold (maximum cost we can tolerate)

Cost Level
-> Based on cost threshold (budget) (here frequency is accounted for)


SanityCheckCostPass - Finds costs of sanity checks
SanityCheckInstructionsPass - Finds instructions belonging to sanity checks
AsapPass - removes checks (Optimizes)


Cost is Cost model cost * gcov freq
